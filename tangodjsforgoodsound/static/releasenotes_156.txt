Release notes 1.5.6
Released: 2020-11-28
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important change in this release is the partial revision of
the DJ edit page. Users can now get help from of a popup for each
input category. This is the first time that colors (green and orange)
are used on the page.

Amazingly, we found a bug (#125) that was already in version 1.0 ;-)

DJs with Vinyl/Shellac now have their own audio format (ANALOG).

Test instructions overworked.

Database migration helpers implemented in tdjs script.

This release requires a database migration.

Fixed requirements:

#117 djedit: Notes on entering Data
#123 Rename Field "Last changed" to "Last change"
#124 Rearrange links 

Fixed bugs:

#120 DJs using Vinyl 
#125 Alternative audio format not displayed (anymore) 

Closed without fix:

#126 Improve Testing => until further notice we will do nothing
