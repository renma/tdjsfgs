<h1>Project</h1>

<p>
  We are two Tango-DJs located in Switzerland aiming for a good sound
  in milongas.

<p>
  <br />By creating this website we hope to bring together DJs and milonga
  organizers who share this aim:
  <ul>
    <li>DJs have the opportunity to share or explain their instruments, equipment and ideas.
    <li>Beginner and advanced DJs find inspiration to improve their work concerning sound quality.
    <li>Milonga organizers find support in locating DJs who provide good sound.
  </ul>

<p class="margin-top">
  <br />The most important factors for good sound in a venue are the
  following:
<ul>
  <li>Organizers responsibility<br />Good loudspeakers, good PA equipment and a good room acoustics.
  <li>DJs responsibility<br />Good quality transfers of the original recordings and good quality audio tools.
</ul>

<p class="margin-top">
  <br />We trust in our DJ-colleagues' honesty and accuracy concerning data
  entry. We do not assume responsibility for their statements.
