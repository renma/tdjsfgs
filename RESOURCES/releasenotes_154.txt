Release notes 1.5.4
Released: 2020-11-08
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All changes to make the application executable on Uberspace7:

- tdjs-script (python path and server address)
- settings.py (added: list of allowed hosts and new mail server address)
- tdjs2-script deleted as it is no longer used

All changes to make the application executable on cumparsita.ch again:

- tdjs-script (use .qmail-cumparsita from
  tdjsfgs@centaurus.uberspace.de for starting and stopping the
  application. Note, that this must be adjusted to tdjsfgs@uber.space
  once the old account is gone).

Fixed issues:

#110 Timestamps in Logfile should be in local time.

#111 Password Reset fails (sometimes).

Outside the application:

- DNS entries adjusted.

- Mail settings simplified as much as possible.
