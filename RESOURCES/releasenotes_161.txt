Release notes 1.6.1
Released: 2022-10-16
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes are included in this release:

- Trailing slashes in void elements removed
  Using trailing slashes in void elements promotes a misleading mental model of
  HTML where the trailing slash looks like it has some special significance -
  when in fact, as the HTML standard says, it's "unnecessary and has no effect
  of any kind".

- Send emails in the background
  If someone wants to send us an e-mail or request a password reset, it often
  takes a long time for the page to respond after pressing the corresponding
  button. The reason for this is not us, but a "malfunction" of the email
  server at uberspace.de. The server simply does not respond for a long time
  (up to 9 seconds!) after the request to send. In the end a simple background
  task was 100% sufficient to solve this issue.

- As always, some smaller updates, improvements and cleanups have also been
  made. This time we have integrated the version tool from rpystart.
