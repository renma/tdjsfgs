Release notes 1.5.7
Released: 2021-01-15
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important change in this release is a search field on the DJ
page. This makes it possible to filter DJs by name, country or style.

For the DJ table in the Django admin interface we have added an admin
helper, so that the database fields 'name', 'number_of_milongas',
'last_changed' and 'useremail' are displayed per default.

As always <style.css> was improved a litlle.

The python code checker now accepts very long lines (created by the
database migration script).

Fixed requirements:

#096 Link page adjusted
#100 Added a search function to the DJ page
#121 Show last changed field (beside others) in Django admin interface
#122 Modification of DJ Site (added table headers and last changed field)

Fixed bugs:

The technology site has now its own id (not user visible).

Closed without fix:

None.
